 This repository implements an efficient pathfinding algorithm designed to find the maximum number of tourist attractions you can visit between a given source and destination within a specified time limit. The problem is modeled as a graph where nodes represent attractions, edges represent routes, and weights on the edges signify travel times between locations.
